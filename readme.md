Vampire
==============

ML-enabled VAMPIRE is under development!

Based on my previous research work: 
1.[Influence of vacancy type defects on the exchange integrals in ferromagnetic metals: a Monte-Carlo-based approach](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1402-4896/ad3505)
2.[Temperature-dependent magnetic properties of bcc and fcc FeNi alloys: A machine learning assisted Monte-Carlo approach] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921452624007300?via%3Dihub)
