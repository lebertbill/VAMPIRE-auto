# Vampire

Originally developed by Richard Evans

## ML-enabled VAMPIRE is under development!

Based on my previous research work:
1. [Influence of vacancy type defects on the exchange integrals in ferromagnetic metals: a Monte-Carlo-based approach](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1402-4896/ad3505)

2. [Temperature-dependent magnetic properties of bcc and fcc FeNi alloys: A machine learning assisted Monte-Carlo approach](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921452624007300?via%3Dihub)

Vampire is a high performance general purpose code for the atomistic simulation of magnetic materials. Using a variety of common simulation methods it can calculate the equilibrium and dynamic magnetic properties of a wide variety of magnetic materials and phenomena, including ferro, ferri and antiferromagnets, core-shell nanoparticles, ultrafast spin dynamics, magnetic recording media, heat assisted magnetic recording, exchange bias, magnetic multilayer films and complete devices.
